# NY-Sewershed-Populations
R scripts for adding population data to NY sewersheds for publication.
These scripts use tidycensus, tigris, and sf to intersect and assign estimates for total population and related census variables of interest to sewershed polygons in New York State, USA. Intersection functions can be applied to other jurisdictions by calling different states and providing different geospatial polygon data.
